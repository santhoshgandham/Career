# Career
Hello, I'm Santhosh, a second year undergrad studying at IIT Madras pursuing B.Tech in Electrical Engineering. Eventually as my interests got aligned with the Core Engineering, I started to develop the following codes that reflect my work in the course and non-course projects I've taken up during the tenure. Moreover, as a core aspirant, I wish to seek knowledge, expertise, and experience from interns in any of the domains my field offers.
